;; Translate LCC opcodes to PCF2 opcodes.  Also removes forward jumps
;; and creates the appropriate muxes.
;;
;; Each function should take an extra parameter, the pointer to the
;; mux condition wire.  This ensures that a function can be called
;; conditionally, as its assignments will all use multiplexers.  We
;; will eventually use an interprocedural dataflow analysis framework
;; to handle the removal of these muxes from functions that are never
;; called conditionally.
;;
;; Since the use of a pointer to the condition wire will carry some
;; cost, we should also have a points-to analysis framework that can
;; be used to remove extraneous copy and multiplexer operations.

This method should return the updated stack, wires, and instructions.  Instructions should be given in reverse order, as this allows instructions to be appended to the instructions list efficiently.

The \"argbase\" parameter represents the list of arguments for the next function call.  When a call instruction is emitted, these arguments will be copied to the base of the next stack frame.  \"argsize\" is the number of arguments for the current function, which we use for addrfp instructions and as an offset for addrlp instructions.")
